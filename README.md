# Recurist

Recurist (recurring list) - a simple check list app.

The main goal of the app is to keep your check lists in one place and to give the user a pleasent experience of keeping track of what they must do.

My personal reason for creating this app is that I have a lot of things that I have to take when going to the gym, and if I'm missing something it negativly impact my day.
One of such thing is flipflops. I almost always forget those, and when I do I have to go to the gym shower barefoot and that greatly annoys me because:
1) It's higly unhygenec to go barefoot into public showers
2) It's very slippery and I could fall and injure myself

Another good way to use the app is preping for vacation. That way you can keep track of what your taking with you, and when getting ready to go home you can be sure you don't forget something at the hotel.

I hope this will app bring you a slightly better quality of life :)
